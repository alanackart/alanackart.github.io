When setting up a TCP connection, a Maximum Segment Size (MSS) is agreed upon. This could be considered an MTU at layer 4, but it is not fixed. It is often set to the largest payload that can be sent in a TCP segment without causing fragmentation, thus reflecting the lowest layer 2 MTU on the path. With an ethernet MTU of 1500, this MSS would be 1460 after subtracting 20 bytes for the IPv4 and TCP header.
