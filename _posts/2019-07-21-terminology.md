# Rust

## immutable

# General

## implicit vs explicit:

**implicit** when it is **implied** but not directly stated. Something is **explicit** when it is directly stated and leaves no room for uncertainty.

## Static/Dynamic vs Strong/Weak(PL)

- *Static/Dynamic Typing* is about **when** type information is acquired (Either at compile time or at runtime)
- *Strong/Weak Typing* is about **how strictly** types are distinguished (e.g. whether the language tries to do an implicit conversion from strings to numbers).

## Recursion

recursion vs iteration vs dynamic programming

# loose coupling

Loose coupling is an approach to interconnecting the components in a system or [network](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/network) so that those components, also called elements, depend on each other to the least extent practicable. Coupling refers to the degree of direct knowledge that one element has of another.

# ephemeral vs persistent storage

# CUDA

**CUDA** (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a [parallel computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing) platform and [application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) (API) model created by [Nvidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#cite_note-1) It allows [software developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer) and [software engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineer) to use a CUDA-enabled [graphics processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) (GPU) for general purpose processing – an approach termed [GPGPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU) (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units). The CUDA platform is a software layer that gives direct access to the GPU's virtual [instruction set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set) and parallel computational elements, for the execution of [compute kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compute_kernel).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#cite_note-CUDA_intro_-_TomsHardware-2)

## [Profiling (computer programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming))

## round trip vs two one way

## Front-End and Back-End

# Thread

## detach

leave or separate oneself from (a group or place).

# Others
