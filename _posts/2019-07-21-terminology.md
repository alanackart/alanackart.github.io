# Rust

## immutable

re-assignment of **immutable** variable `sum`: Unchanging over time or unable to be changed

## trait

the trait bound `{float}: std::ops::AddAssign<{integer}>` is not satisfied， A distinguishing quality or characteristic, typically one belonging to a person.

# General

## implicit vs explicit:

**implicit** when it is **implied** but not directly stated. Something is **explicit** when it is directly stated and leaves no room for uncertainty.

## Static/Dynamic vs Strong/Weak(PL)

- *Static/Dynamic Typing* is about **when** type information is acquired (Either at compile time or at runtime)
- *Strong/Weak Typing* is about **how strictly** types are distinguished (e.g. whether the language tries to do an implicit conversion from strings to numbers).
