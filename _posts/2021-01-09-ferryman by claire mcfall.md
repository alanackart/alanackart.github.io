# About Claire McFall

Claire McFall is a former English teacher from Scotland who now lives in sunny (sunny) Colorado with her family.  Her first book, Ferryman, is a love story which retells the ancient Greek myth of Charon, the ferryman of Hades who transported souls to the Underworld.  The novel won the 2013 Scottish Children's Book Award and was short-listed for the Grampian Children's Book Awards, long-listed for the Branford Boase Award and the UKLA (UK Literary Association) Book Awards, as well as being nominated for the Carnegie Medal.  Trespassers and Outcasts, released in July 2017 and March 2019, complete the trilogy. The FERRYMAN series has now been translated into more than 15 languages, sold in excess of three million copies, and the film rights have been bought by Legendary Entertainment.
