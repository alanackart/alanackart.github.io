Below is all the points on pointer:

1. Every variable is a memory location and every memory location can be get by using ampersand (&) operator.

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   
   int main () {
   
      int  var1;
      char var2[10];
   
      printf("Address of var1 variable: %x\n", &var1  );
      printf("Address of var2 variable: %x\n", &var2  );
   
      return 0;
   }
   ```

2. A pointer is a variable whose value is the the address of the memory location which is  the address of another variable. All kinds of pointers, integer, float, char, FILE is all the same, *a long number.*

3. A good practice is to initialize pointer as *NULL.*

4. On Pointer to Pointer,

   ```c
   int **var; 
   ```
   with one asterisk * means the pointer store the address of a variable, while with two asterisks means it the store the address of a pointer.

   Therefore, when in the case use Pointer to Pointer(in most cases, it was use to return multiple value by using pointer). 
   
5. strcpy 对指针赋值NULL错误
执行strcpy(orgarray -> visibleFlag, NULL);时，会从NULL（也就是地址0x00000000）处读取数据赋值到orgarray -> visibleFlag，而这个地址是操作系统保护的，读取或写入都会造成段错误。

6. 指针的一个等价写法
 int x =  7;
    int *a = &x;
    int *b;
    b = &x;//b 是一个存放地址的指针变量

7. 不同环境下的编译器错误处理方式可能不同, windows与linux， windows如何产生core dump...

8. 指针和前置++后置++的优先级顺序rule:
1) Precedence of prefix ++ and * is same. Associativity of both is right to left.
2) Precedence of postfix ++ is higher than both * and prefix ++. Associativity of postfix ++ is left to right.
