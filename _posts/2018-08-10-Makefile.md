# compiler flag

> Use the `LIBADD` primary for libraries, and `LDADD` for executables. If you were building a libtool library `libfoo.la`, that depended on another library `libbar.la`, you would use:
>
> ```
> libfoo_la_LIBADD = libbar.la
> ```
>
> If you had other non-libtool libraries, you would also add these with `-L` and `-l` options:
>
> ```
> libfoo_la_LIBADD = libbar.la -L/opt/local/lib -lpng
> ```
>
> Typically, you would use the configure script to find these extra libraries, and use `AC_SUBST` to pass them with:
>
> ```
> libfoo_la_LIBADD = libbar.la $(EXTRA_FOO_LIBS)
> ```
>
> For a program, just use `LDADD` :
>
> ```
> myprog_LDADD = libfoo.la # links libfoo, libbar, and libpng to myprog.
> ```
>
> Sometimes the boundaries are a bit vague. `$(EXTRA_FOO_LIBS)` could have been added to `myprog_LDADD`. Adding dependencies to a libtool (`.la`) library, and using `libtool` do all the platform-specific linker magic, is usually the best approach. It keeps all the linker metadata in the one place.
