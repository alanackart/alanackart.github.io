Make知识点总结， 有时间再补充些自己比较困惑的点

# 为什么使用make

1、包含多个源文件的项目在编译时有长而复杂的命令行，可以通过makefile保存这些命令行来简化该工作
2、make可以减少重新编译所需要的时间，因为make可以识别出哪些文件是新修改的
3、Make维护了当前项目中各文件的相关关系，从而可以在编译前检查是否可以找到所有的文件

自己也用了很久的make, 以上回答的这3点我也都知道， 可是从来没有系统的写下来总结过， 感谢[Make面试题](https://blog.csdn.net/IOT_SHUN/article/details/79494928)

# Special Built-in Target Names

Certain names have special meanings if they appear as targets.[Special-Targets](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-Targets)

## `.PHONY`

The prerequisites of the special target `.PHONY` are considered to be phony targets. When it is time to consider such a target, `make` will run its recipe unconditionally, regardless of whether a file with that name exists or what its last-modification time is. See [Phony Targets](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Phony-Targets).

```
.PHONY: clean
clean:
        rm *.o temp
```

Once this is done, ‘make clean’ will run the recipe regardless of whether there is a file named clean.

## `.SUFFIXES` 

后缀自定义规则， 定义某一类型的文件的处理规则

# compiler flag

> Use the `LIBADD` primary for libraries, and `LDADD` for executables. If you were building a libtool library `libfoo.la`, that depended on another library `libbar.la`, you would use:
>
> ```
> libfoo_la_LIBADD = libbar.la
> ```
>
> If you had other non-libtool libraries, you would also add these with `-L` and `-l` options:
>
> ```
> libfoo_la_LIBADD = libbar.la -L/opt/local/lib -lpng
> ```
>
> Typically, you would use the configure script to find these extra libraries, and use `AC_SUBST` to pass them with:
>
> ```
> libfoo_la_LIBADD = libbar.la $(EXTRA_FOO_LIBS)
> ```
>
> For a program, just use `LDADD` :
>
> ```
> myprog_LDADD = libfoo.la # links libfoo, libbar, and libpng to myprog.
> ```
>
> Sometimes the boundaries are a bit vague. `$(EXTRA_FOO_LIBS)` could have been added to `myprog_LDADD`. Adding dependencies to a libtool (`.la`) library, and using `libtool` do all the platform-specific linker magic, is usually the best approach. It keeps all the linker metadata in the one place.
